# Configuration

girok-md is configured through the `setting.toml` file in your project root.

## Basic Configuration

```toml title="setting.toml"
# Required: Path to your markdown files
source_root_path = "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"

# Blog name (displayed in header and metadata)
blog_name = "My Blog"

# Site URL for SEO (sitemap, canonical URLs)
site_url = "https://username.github.io"

# Locale: "en" or "ko"
locale = "en"
```

## Configuration Options

### `source_root_path`

**Required.** The absolute path to your markdown folder (e.g., Obsidian vault).

```toml
source_root_path = "/Users/john/Documents/Obsidian/MyVault"
```

:::caution
Use absolute paths only. Relative paths are not supported.

### `blog_name`

The name of your blog. Displayed in the header and used in page titles.

```toml
blog_name = "John's Tech Blog"
```

### `site_url`

Your site's URL. Used for:
- Generating sitemap.xml
- Setting canonical URLs for SEO
- Open Graph meta tags

```toml
site_url = "https://john.github.io"
```

### `locale`

The default language for your blog. Affects date formatting and UI labels.

```toml

```

## Intro Section

Configure the intro section displayed on the home page:

```toml
[intro]
title = "Welcome to My Blog"
description = "Sharing my thoughts on technology and life"
```

## Environment Variables

You can also use environment variables for sensitive values:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Local development">
    Create a `.env` file:
    ```bash title=".env"
    PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-site.com
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="GitHub Actions">
    Add secrets in your repository settings:
    - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
    - Add your environment variables
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## File Structure After Configuration

After running `npm run sync`, your project structure will look like:

```
