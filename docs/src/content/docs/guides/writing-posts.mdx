import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

girok-md makes it easy to write posts in your favorite markdown editor and publish them to your blog.

## Frontmatter

Every post needs frontmatter to define its metadata. Add `publish: true` to include it on your blog.

```markdown title="my-post.md"
---
title: My First Post
publish: true
date: 2024-01-15
tags: [astro, blog, tutorial]
description: This is my first post on my new blog
---

Your post content starts here...
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | The title of your post |
| `publish` | Set to `true` to publish, `false` to hide |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `date` | Publication date | File creation date |
| `tags` | Array of tags | `[]` |
| `description` | Short description for SEO | First 150 characters |
| `aliases` | Alternative slugs/paths | `[]` |

## Publishing Workflow

<Aside type="tip" title="Incremental Sync">
girok-md only syncs files that have changed since the last sync, making builds fast and efficient.
</Aside>

1. Write your post in your markdown editor (e.g., Obsidian)
2. Add `publish: true` to the frontmatter
3. Run `npm run sync` to sync your posts
4. Run `npm run dev` to preview locally
5. Commit and push to deploy

## Sync Behavior

The sync process:

1. Scans `source_root_path` for markdown files
2. Only includes files with `publish: true`
3. Compares `modified` time with `publish_sync_at`
4. Copies changed files to `src/content/posts/`
5. Removes deleted or unpublished files

### Forcing a Full Sync

To re-sync all files regardless of modification time:

```bash
rm -rf src/content/posts && npm run sync
```

## Slug Generation

The URL slug is generated from:

1. The `title` field in frontmatter (primary)
2. The filename (fallback)

**Examples:**

| Title | Generated Slug |
|-------|---------------|
| `My First Post` | `/posts/my-first-post` |
| `안녕하세요 World` | `/posts/안녕하세요-world` |
| `Post (2024)` | `/posts/post-2024` |

## Images

Place images in the same folder as your markdown files. They will be synced automatically to `public/assets/`.

See [Markdown Syntax](/girok-md/guides/markdown-syntax) for image embed syntax.
