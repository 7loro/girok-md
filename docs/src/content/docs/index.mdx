> **Your record becomes a map for others.**

**girok.md** (기록.md) is an open-source static blog generator built with [Astro](https://astro.build). It transforms your Obsidian markdown files into a beautiful, fast, and SEO-optimized blog.

The name combines **girok** (기록, Korean for "record" or "documentation") with **.md** (Markdown). It reflects the core philosophy: your personal records, written in Markdown, become valuable documentation for others.

## Philosophy

**The Power of Recording**

- **Personal Records**: Traces left behind so you don't forget what you've learned.
- **Shared Records**: Milestones from your journey that help others grow.

Your notes are more than personal memos—they become a map that guides someone else's path.
