## npm Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server on `localhost:4321` |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run sync` | Sync posts from source folder |
| `npm run clean` | Clean synced posts |
| `npm test` | Run tests |

## Development

### `npm run dev`

Starts the Astro development server with hot module replacement.

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Default URL: http://localhost:4321
- Hot reloading enabled
- Draft posts visible

### `npm run preview`

Preview the production build locally before deploying.

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
```

## Building

### `npm run build`

Builds your site for production.

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:
1. Compiles all Astro pages to static HTML
2. Bundles and minifies CSS/JS
3. Runs Pagefind to generate search index

Output is in the `dist/` folder.

## Syncing

### `npm run sync`

Syncs markdown files from your source folder to `src/content/posts/`.

```bash
npm run sync
```

**Behavior:**
- Reads `source_root_path` from `setting.toml`
- Scans for `.md` files with `publish: true`
- Copies new/changed files to `src/content/posts/`
- Copies images to `public/assets/`
- Removes posts that were unpublished or deleted

**Options:**

```bash
# Force full sync (re-sync all files)
rm -rf src/content/posts && npm run sync
```

### `npm run clean`

Removes all synced posts and assets.

```bash
npm run clean
```

This clears:
- `src/content/posts/`
- `public/assets/` (synced images only)

## Testing

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite with Vitest.

```bash
npm test
```

**Other test commands:**

```bash
# Run once (no watch)
npx vitest run

# Run specific file
npx vitest run scripts/__tests__/sync.test.ts

# Run by test name
npx vitest -t "should convert"
```

## Pagefind

The search index is automatically built during `npm run build` via the `postbuild` script.

To manually build the search index:

```bash
npx pagefind --site dist
```
