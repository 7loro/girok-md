# Nginx Configuration
# Nginx is a web server that delivers built HTML/CSS/JS/image files to browsers.
# It serves static files efficiently without needing Node.js at runtime.

server {
    # Listen on unprivileged port (8080 instead of 80 for better security)
    listen 8080;
    server_name _;

    # Directory containing the built site files
    root /app/dist;
    index index.html;

    # -- Gzip Compression --
    # Compresses files before sending to make pages load faster
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/css application/javascript application/json image/svg+xml;
    gzip_min_length 256;

    # -- Cache Settings --
    # Caching lets browsers store files locally so they don't re-download on revisit

    # Astro-generated CSS/JS (filenames include a hash, so they change when content changes)
    # Safe to cache for 1 year (immutable = content never changes for the same filename)
    location /_astro/ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }

    # Image files: 7-day cache
    location /assets/ {
        expires 7d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }

    # Pagefind search index: 1-day cache
    location /pagefind/ {
        expires 1d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }

    # -- URL Routing --
    # Maps clean URLs to files: /posts/my-post → /posts/my-post/index.html
    # Returns 404 if no matching file is found
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/index.html =404;
    }

    # Custom 404 error page
    error_page 404 /404.html;
}
